# string_pattern_match

### Tech-stack used in this project: Levenshtein distance, Fuzz Ratio

Initially text preprocessing was don on the texts and then the most common words were determined using fuzz.token_sort_ratio, with the help of which we can extract "n" numbered similar pattern words, measuring through percentage(/100) of similarity.
