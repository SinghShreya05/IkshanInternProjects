## Tech-stack used: OpenCV and Bounding Box Formation
<br />
To form bounding box, "Yolov4" architecture was used, darknet is also uploaded and weights can be download from the Yolov4 web.
<br />
For the pest detection, initially image was reduced to grey scale image, contour detection using erosion and dilation was applied to finally determine number of pests on a surface.
